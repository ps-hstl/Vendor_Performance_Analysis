# Vendor_Performance_Analysis
A data-driven analysis project to evaluate vendor performance, optimize inventory, and boost profitability using Python and Power BI.


ðŸ“Š Vendor Performance Analysis-->
This project analyzes vendor and brand performance in a retail/wholesale environment by integrating purchase, sales, and freight data. Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, it identifies profitability drivers, evaluates vendor efficiency, and delivers actionable insights for inventory and vendor management.
